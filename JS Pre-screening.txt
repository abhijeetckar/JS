1. What type of language is JavaScript?
a) dynamically compiled type
b) INTERPRETED LANGUAGE
c) functional language
d) weakly typed language

2. What does the term "declaration" refer to?
a) initializing a variable with a value
b) allocating memory for a variable
c) INTRODUCING THE EXISTENCE OF A VARIABLE WITHOUT DEFINING ITS VALUE.
d) assigning a value to a variable

3. Which of the following is a consequence of the Temporal Dead Zone ?
a) Variables declared with var, let and const are inaccessible before their declaration.
b) VARIABLES DECLARED WITH LET AND CONST CANNOT BE ACCESSED OR INITIALIZED BEFORE THEIR DECLARATION.
c) Functions declared within a block are hoisted above variable declarations.
d) Variables declared with let and const are initialized to undefined in the temporal dead zone.

4. What is the key difference between parallelism and concurrency?
a) parallelism primarily focuses on managing tasks, while concurrency aims to execute tasks simultaneously.
b) parallelism can only occur on a multi-core processor, while concurrency can occur on both single-core and multi-core processors.
c) PARALLELISM IMPROVES THE SPEED OF TASK EXECUTION, WHEREAS CONCURRENCY IMPROVES THE EXECUTION OF A PROGRAM BY DEALING WITH MULTIPLE TASKS.
d) parallelism involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously, while concurrency involves managing the execution of tasks.

5. Which of the following data structures is NOT iterable in JavaScript?
a) array
b) OBJECT
c) map
d) set

6. Which of the following is a use case for closures?
a) ENCAPSULATING PRIVATE DATA WITHIN A FUNCTION.
b) creating lexical scopes within a function.
c) managing scope and preventing variable pollution.
d) implementing partial application and currying.

7. What is the purpose of process nextTick function in Node.js?
a) to execute a callback at the next iteration of the event loop
b) to execute a callback asynchronously
c) TO EXECUTE A CALLBACK AT THE START OF NEXT ITERATION OF EVENT LOOP 
d) to execute a callback at the end of current iteration of event loop 

8. What is the primary purpose of Worker Threads in Node.js?
a) to handle blocking i/o operations asynchronously
b) TO EXECUTE JAVASCRIPT CODE IN PARALLEL WITH THE MAIN EVENT LOOP
c) to manage multiple node.js processes for load balancing
d) to optimize memory usage in node.js applications

9. What is the behavior when an asynchronous function is called within a for loop in Node application?
a) each iteration of the loop returns the result and moves to next iteration.
B) THE ASYNC FUNCTION EXECUTES IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE LOOP TO COMPLETE.
c) the loop completes all iterations before any async function is executed.
d) the async function executes in parallel with the loop iterations, but the order of execution is not guaranteed.

10. Which of the following best describes a Promise in JavaScript?
a) a guarantee that a function will return a result without stopping the execution of code.
b) AN OBJECT REPRESENTING THE STATE OF AN ASYNCHRONOUS OPERATION.
c) a callback function passed to an asynchronous operation which will return a result in future.
d) a wrapper around asynchronous code to make execute in background.

11. What are events in Node.js?
a) functions that execute when a certain condition is met.
b) OBJECTS REPRESENTING USER ACTIONS.
c) built-in methods for handling asynchronous tasks.
d) special functions used to trigger code execution.

12. What is one advantage of NoSQL databases over SQL databases?
a) strong acid transactions
b) strict schema enforcement
c) HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY
d) joins across tables
